Description: preseqR provides functions to estimate the number of species 
represented at least r times in a random sample based on an initial sample. It
generalizes the classic problem where r is equal to 1. We use a mixture of 
Poisson processes to model sampling procedures and apply a nonparametric
empirical Bayes approach to derive an estimator. For more information on
preseqR, see Deng C, Daley T and Smith AD (2015) <10.1007/s40484-015-0049-7>
