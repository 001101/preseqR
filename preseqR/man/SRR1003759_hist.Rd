\title{A Histogram of Single-cell RNA-seq Experiment} 

\description{ 
SRR1003759_hist is a histogram, which has 2760 rows and 2 columns. Each row 
(x, y) represents there are y distinct reads, each of which occurs x times in 
the Single-cell RNA-seq experiment. The raw sequencing data is from NCBI with
accession No. SRX360948. The RNA-seq aligner STAR is used to map reads into 
hg19. SRR1003759_5M_hist is the histogram of all mapped reads.
